## Why Contribute Anonymously

Anonymous contributions can protect your personal privacy and prevent the leakage of personal identification information. It also allows you to participate more freely in different open source projects.

## Creating an Anonymous GitHub Account

1. Sign out of your current GitHub account:
   - Click on your avatar in the top-right corner of GitHub, then select "Sign out".

2. Create a new anonymous account:
   - Visit the [GitHub registration page](https://github.com/join).
   - Use a new email address that does not contain any personal information.
   - Choose a username that does not reveal your identity.
   - Complete the registration steps to create the new account.

## Using Temporary Email Services

To further ensure anonymity, you can use a disposable email service to register your new GitHub account:

1. Visit a disposable email service website (e.g., [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/) or [Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/)).
2. Obtain a temporary email address.
3. Use this temporary email address to create a new GitHub account (see steps above).

## Submitting Anonymous Contributions

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
   cd project-name
