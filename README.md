# Alongside code for paper : "SoK: FHE-Friendly Symmetric Ciphers and Transciphering"


## This source code consists of three parts. For each part, you should enter the respective subdirectory and run the code.

# 1. RtF framework part

## New Package
We implement the hybrid framework in [./RtF_framework/ckks_fv/](./RtF_framework/ckks_fv/), which contains the following functionalities.
- Evaluation of the HERA/Rubato cipher in the FV scheme
- Evaluation of the Masta/Pasta cipher in the FV scheme

We implement the ResNet-20 cnn_infer in [./RtF_framework/cnn_infer/](./RtF_framework/cnn_infer/), which contains the following functionalities.
- ResNet20 inference scheme (located at (./cnn_infer))
- Masta/Pasta cipher in the FV scheme subquent the cnn_infer
- HERA/Rubato cipher in the FV scheme subquent the cnn_infer

We implement the GAWS chisqtest in [./RtF_framework/chisqtest/](./RtF_framework/chisqtest/), which contains the following functionalities.
- chisq test scheme (located at (./chisq.go))
- Masta/Pasta cipher in the FV scheme subquent the chisqtest
- HERA/Rubato cipher in the FV scheme subquent the chisqtest

We implement the MiniMax compare in [./RtF_framework/minimax_comp/](./RtF_framework/minimax_comp/), which contains the following functionalities.
- compare scheme (located at (./minimax_comp.go))
- Masta/Pasta cipher in the FV scheme subquent the minimax_comp
- HERA/Rubato cipher in the FV scheme subquent the minimax_comp

An example of Running ResNet20 inference in the RtF framework is given in [examples/resnet](./RtF_framework/examples/resnet/main.go).

An example of Running compare in the RtF framework is given in [examples/compare](./RtF_framework/examples/compare/main.go).
